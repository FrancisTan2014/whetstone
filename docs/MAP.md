# Repository map

Navigational index: subsystems to their locations. **Pointers and invariants only — never
restated code behavior.** Read `PRODUCT.md` and `GUIDELINES.md`, then this map, then only the one
feature slice you need. Maintained per `GUIDELINES.md` -> "Knowledge surfaces and onboarding cost":
updated by the same PR that changes an area's shape, not on every change.

When a folder below outgrows its single entry here, give it a colocated `AGENTS.md` and shrink its
entry to a pointer.

## Packages

### `src/packages/document/` — content document model (bedrock)

The Tiptap/ProseMirror schema for whetstone content (PRODUCT "Architecture: the document-model
bedrock"). Pure and Node-runnable (no DOM; HTML parsing/rendering belong to the ingestion/reader
slices). Public surface is `src/index.ts`. Units: `nodes.ts` (Tiptap `Node.create` specs for doc,
text, prose blocks, nesting lists, tables, figures, definition lists, callout, footnote marker/target,
and a raw-HTML `unknown` fallback — the `image` node carries an `imageResourceId` attr (default null)
so a resolved EPUB image can be referenced by the reader; `documentExtensions` couples the specs with
the UniqueID id attribute), `schema.ts` (`documentSchema` via `getSchema`; `generateNodeId`), `document.ts`
(`parseDocument`/`serializeDocument`/`isValidDocument`/`assignNodeIds` JSON round-trip + validation,
`DocumentValidationError`). Stable node ids use Tiptap UniqueID's server-side generator. Tests
colocated. Invariant: depends on nothing outward; no UI, ingestion, or editing here.

### `src/packages/domain/` — pure logic

Entry/link/block/template/note-anchor rules with no React, Fastify, DB, fs, or env. Public surface is
`src/index.ts`. Current units: `entry.ts`, `links.ts`, `block.ts`, `markdownBlocks.ts` (decompose
Markdown into ordered, stable-id blocks; exports the shared `blockFromMdastNode` mapper, which
strips image nodes — v0 is text blocks only — and skips a block left empty by that removal),
`blockDiff.ts` (content-similarity diff matching new blocks to existing ones — Dice-bigram alignment —
to preserve stable ids on re-ingestion), `htmlBlocks.ts` (decompose one EPUB chapter's XHTML into a
reading unit of blocks via `rehype-parse` + `rehype-remark`; detects structural `<figure>`/top-level
`<img>` at the hast stage and emits figure blocks carrying the transient image src + alt + caption,
consuming `<figcaption>` so it is never a heading or the unit title), `epubMetadata.ts` (normalize OPF
title/author/language), `blockMarkdown.ts` (serialize a block's mdast back to Markdown for safe
rendering; `blocksToMarkdown` reconstructs a whole work for export), `author.ts`, `work.ts`,
`noteTemplate.ts` (v0 note templates +
size-based preselection), `noteAnswers.ts` (answer validation + note-body Markdown), `noteAnchor.ts`
(anchors a note to a block id with an optional sub-block offset range), `productIdentity.ts`. Tests
are colocated `*.test.ts`. Invariant: depends on nothing outward.

### `src/packages/contracts/` — shared API schemas/DTOs

Zod request/response contracts shared by client and server. Public surface is `src/index.ts`.
Current contracts: `entryContracts.ts`, `libraryContracts.ts`, `contentContracts.ts`,
`noteContracts.ts`, `lookupContracts.ts` (the lookup route query validator + the shared
`NormalizedEntry` shape and `LookupResponse` DTO rendered by the reader), `searchContracts.ts`
(the `/api/search` query validator + the block-level `SearchResultsDto`), `health.ts`. Tests colocated.
Invariant: types resolve through built `dist` — run `pnpm build` (or `tsc -b`) before VS Code/tsc
can navigate them from another package.

## Apps

### `src/apps/server/` — Fastify API

- Composition/entry: `src/index.ts` (in-memory PGlite unless `DATABASE_DIR` is set); `dev-server.mjs`
  is the local dev entrypoint, run via `tsx watch` (`pnpm --filter @whetstone/server dev`) so the
  server runs from **source with reload** — a newly landed route is live without a manual `build` (no
  stale `dist/` 404s) — and it defaults `DATABASE_DIR` to a git-ignored `.data/db` so content
  survives a restart. `start` (`node dist/index.js`) is the production path. Server assembly in
  `src/http/createServer.ts`.
- Single-origin serving: when `WEB_DIR` is set, `createServer`'s `web` option registers
  `src/http/staticWeb.ts` (`@fastify/static`) so the built web client is served at `/` alongside
  `/api/*` from one port — the deploy path (#184). Unset in dev/tests, where Vite serves the client.
- Identity seam: `src/identity/currentUser.ts` — the single `DEFAULT_USER_ID` constant + the
  `CurrentUserProvider` (`getCurrentUserId()`). `createServer` decorates the instance with it
  (`request.server.currentUser`), defaulting to the v0 provider; tests/future auth inject their own.
  No users table, login, session, or content owner yet (PRODUCT.md "Identity & ownership (v0)").
  `notes` is the first user-owned table: note routes resolve the current user via
  `request.server.currentUser` and stamp `notes.user_id` on create / filter note reads by it
  (`noteCommands.ts`/`noteQueries.ts`); `reading_positions` is user-owned the same way; `recall_items`
  - `recall_reviews` (the recall store, below) are user-owned the same way; shared
    content tables stay unowned.
- Recall store: `src/features/recall/` (`recallCommands.ts` enroll/recordReview, `recallQueries.ts`
  listDue/list/search/get + ReviewState<->row mapping) over `recall_items` (SM-2 review state inline +
  optional `provenance_entry_id` into the content graph, and an optional `chunk_id` link to a practice
  chunk (#205)) and `recall_reviews` (append-only history).
  Pure scheduling is `@whetstone/domain` SM-2; DTOs/validation in `@whetstone/contracts`
  (`recallContracts.ts`). Data + operations layer only.
- Case/map content model: `src/features/cases/` (`caseSeed.ts` seeds the authored corpus on boot;
  `caseQueries.ts` `listDomains`/`listCasesInDomain`/`getCaseDetail`) over shared `domains` -> `cases`
  -> `chunks`. The case detail returns the chunk inventory plus a per-user mastery summary COMPUTED
  (never stored) from the user's `recall_items.chunk_id` links via `@whetstone/domain`
  `summarizeCaseMastery`. Corpus + mastery logic are pure in `@whetstone/domain`
  (`caseCorpus.ts`/`caseMastery.ts`); DTOs in `@whetstone/contracts` (`caseContracts.ts`).
- Case authoring (#209): `src/features/authoring/` — `authoringCommands.ts` (`authorCase` calls the coach
  seam to author a case + chunks into #205, persisted as `needs_review` and **cached by brief key** so a
  repeat brief reuses the stored case with no model call; `reviewCase` edits/accepts -> `active`) and
  `authoringQueries.ts` (`listCasesNeedingReview`, the curation queue). Cases carry a `status`
  (`active` default; authored start `needs_review`) and a unique `brief_key`; the practice ranking in
  `features/learner` only loads `active` cases, so unreviewed authored content is never practised.
  Shapes in `@whetstone/contracts` (`caseContracts.ts`).
- Recall MCP server: `src/mcp/` exposes the recall store to any MCP client (a local/cloud LLM coach) —
  `recallTools.ts` (five tools mapping 1:1 to the recall ops; validate via contracts; `createRecallMcpServer`)
  and the stdio entry `mcp/main.ts` (run via `pnpm --filter @whetstone/server mcp`). Thin adapter; no
  logic duplicated. Tool list + transport: `docs/MCP.md`.
- Coach LLM seam: `src/coach/` — the model-agnostic boundary the language loop calls (like the
  dictionary seam). `coachProvider.ts` (the `CoachProvider` interface: judge / gradeForScheduler /
  propose / author / converse / analyze), `fakeCoach.ts` (a deterministic, keyless fake so the loop builds
  and runs with no API key), `coachRouter.ts` (cost-routing — judge/converse/analyze=strong,
  propose/author=cheap, configurable) and `coachConfig.ts` (env-driven routing + an absent-config-safe
  `resolveCoach` that stays on the fake until real adapters + a key are wired). `converse` (#220) is the
  conversational next-turn call the live loop makes per user turn (no per-turn grading); `analyze` (#222)
  is the end-of-round one-pass call: the whole round (transcript + word-timings + the case's target chunks
  - compiled context) -> a grade per chunk, the top tagged mistakes, wins, and one native upgrade (the
    only place a round is graded). Both `converse` and `analyze` carry the adaptive **`CoachKnobs`** (#223)
    — difficulty/focus/probe-patterns derived deterministically from the learner model by `deriveCoachKnobs`
    (`@whetstone/domain` `coachKnobs.ts`), briefing the FIXED coach skill (no self-tuning yet). The knobs also
    carry the **bilingual language-mix dial** (#270): `targetL1Share` (from the learner's English share via
    `languageMix.ts`) lets the cheap-tier `converse` reply in the learner's EN/L1 mix while always pushing one
    English target; `englishShare(userTurn)` is recorded per turn on `session_exchanges` as the level signal.
    The verdict
    -> SM-2 grade map is pure in `@whetstone/domain`
    (`coachGrade.ts`); boundary shapes/validation in `@whetstone/contracts` (`coachContracts.ts`).
    `coachAdapters.ts` wires the real tiers — **cheap = local Ollama** (`llama3.1:8b` on
    `127.0.0.1:11434`), **strong = cloud** — each composed over the fake so any model/parse failure
    still grades the round. `coachHealth.ts` is the boot probe (`checkCoachHealth`): it pings the
    local model on startup and reports `local_ready` / `local_unavailable` (with an `ollama pull`
    hint) / `cloud_only` / `fake`, so a missing model degrades cleanly to the fake instead of
    crashing. Deploy + provisioning steps: `docs/COACH.md`.
- Voice input (STT) seam: `src/coach/`'s sibling `src/speech/` — `speechInput.ts` (the `SpeechInput`
  interface: `transcribe(audio) -> { transcript, words[] }`), `fakeSpeechInput.ts` (deterministic, for
  the mic-less `pnpm validate` gate), `whisperSpeechInput.ts` (a local OSS Whisper adapter — builds the
  offline CLI args, validates the word-timestamped JSON at the boundary, maps to a `Transcription`),
  `whisperProcess.ts` (the injected execFile runner) and `speechConfig.ts` (env-driven, absent-config-
  safe `resolveSpeechInput` that stays on the fake until a Whisper binary+model are configured). The
  latency/inter-word-pause derivation is pure in `@whetstone/domain` (`speechTiming.ts`); shapes in
  `@whetstone/contracts` (`speechContracts.ts`). Audio never leaves the machine; setup in
  `docs/SPEECH.md`.
- Learner model: `src/features/learner/` — the retrieval half of the moat. `learnerCommands.ts`
  (`depositTurnOutcome` appends a turn + increments its categorized error pattern; `updateLearnerProfile`
  recomputes the rolling profile — level/strengths/weaknesses/focus — with an injectable phraser for the
  LLM seam) and `learnerQueries.ts` (`compileContext(now)` assembles a BOUNDED slice: rolling profile +
  top gap x frequency chunks + relevant errors + recent outcomes, each capped so size stays ~constant as
  history grows) over user-scoped `error_patterns`, `turn_outcomes`, `learner_profiles`. The gap x
  frequency ranking + level derivation are pure in `@whetstone/domain` (`learnerModel.ts`); shapes in
  `@whetstone/contracts` (`learnerContracts.ts`).
- Progress map: `src/features/map/` — `mapQueries.ts` `compileProgressMap(now)` composes #205 per-case
  mastery into lit/dim/dark light levels (`@whetstone/domain` `caseLightLevel`) over active cases, plus
  owned/weak counts and the #208 recommendation + error trend; exposed by `mapRoutes.ts` at
  `GET /api/progress-map`. Shapes in `@whetstone/contracts` (`mapContracts.ts`). Visualization only — no
  scoring logic.
- Practice session: `src/features/session/` — `sessionEngine.ts` orchestrates the turn loop over the
  coach (#206) and speech (#207) seams + #205/#208/#189: `startSession` proposes cues (top gap x
  frequency chunks; English situation, native target hidden), `submitTurn` judges + grades the
  submitted transcript and DEPOSITS (schedules the chunk's recall item #188/#189, enrolling on first
  practice, + records the turn outcome with its mistake category #208). `converseTurn` (#220) holds a
  conversational coach turn: it loads the case, rebuilds the conversation from the persisted
  `session_exchanges` rows (append-only, user+case scoped, ordered by `order_index`), calls the coach's
  `converse`, persists the learner line + coach reply, and returns the reply (no per-turn grading).
  `endSession` (#222) is the end-of-round one pass: it rebuilds the round (transcript from
  `session_exchanges` + the request's word-timings + the case's target chunks + compiled context), calls
  the coach's `analyze`, and DEPOSITS the durable trace deterministically — chunk grades -> SM-2 recall
  (#188/#189, which also advances case mastery and so the map #210), tagged mistakes -> error-pattern
  counts (#208), and the rolling profile (#208) — then returns the compact debrief. The
  spoken path posts recorded audio bytes to `POST /api/session/transcribe` (the STT seam, via injected
  `saveAudio` + speech, returning transcript + word-timings) and submits the recognized transcript; typing
  is the fallback. `sessionRoutes.ts`: `POST /api/session/` `start|transcribe|turn|say|end`. The
  coach/speech seams are resolved (fakes when unconfigured) in `index.ts`. Mistake-category map is pure in
  `@whetstone/domain` (`mistakeCategory.ts`); shapes in `@whetstone/contracts` (`sessionContracts.ts`).
  Web: the live **call surface** `SessionPage` (#221) — tap **Start call**, talk continuously, the coach
  replies in voice, with **barge-in** and scrolling **live captions**, until **End**; a typed box is the
  secondary no-mic fallback. It wires the foundations end to end: continuous capture + endpointing
  (`liveCapture.ts`, #219) → STT (`transcribe`, #207) → coach (`say` → `/api/session/say`, #220) →
  browser TTS out (`voiceOut.ts`'s `createVoiceOut`, wired to `window.speechSynthesis` in the
  coverage-excluded `browserVoiceOut.ts`). The browser audio/speech boundaries (`liveCapture.ts`,
  `browserVoiceOut.ts`) are injected via the `live` prop and excluded from coverage; the loop
  orchestration, `pickEnglishVoice`/`createVoiceOut`, and `sessionApi` are covered. **End** runs the
  end-of-round analysis (`endSession`) and renders the compact **debrief** (`DebriefView`, #222):
  encouragement, the few moments (said -> native + why), the one upgrade, and what is now due to recall.
  After a soft time-box (`timeBoxMs`, ~15 min) the call surfaces a calm, non-blocking "land the plane"
  nudge offering to wrap up; the explicit **End** still works and the call is never hard-cut.
- Config: `src/config/serverConfig.ts`.
- Data: `src/db/` — `schema.ts` (Drizzle), `dbClient.ts`, `migrate.ts`, `migrations/`.
- Features (feature-first): `src/features/<feature>/` with `*Routes.ts`, `*Commands.ts`,
  `*Queries.ts` (current: `library/`, `content/`, `notes/`, `readingPosition/`, `search/`). Routes stay thin; logic lives in
  commands/queries. `content/` ingests Markdown, EPUB, and PDF uploads. Markdown re-ingestion REPLACES a
  work's content via the domain block diff (`blockReconciler.ts` preserves matched block ids, inserts
  new, soft-deletes removed — `blocks.deleted_at` set + detached `reading_unit_entry_id` — and clears
  the work's `reading_positions` so deleting the replaced unit entries cannot dangle their FK); identical
  source is a no-op. PDF uploads (`POST …/content/pdf`) converge on the Markdown pipeline: `src/files/pdfToMarkdown.ts` (`PdfToMarkdown` seam) converts a PDF to Markdown one-shot — production spawns the isolated Docling worker (`src/files/pdf_to_markdown.py`, MIT, permissive); a deterministic fake keeps the keyless gate green with no Python — then `ingestPdf` reuses `ingestMarkdown` (golden: a PDF ≡ the equivalent `.md`). A scanned PDF gets an OCR pre-pass first (`src/files/pdfOcr.ts`, `PdfOcr` seam, composed via `composePdfToMarkdown`): production spawns OCRmyPDF/Tesseract (`--skip-text`, permissive); the identity fake is a no-op so born-digital ingest is unchanged. EPUB uploads (`epubCommands.ts`) create the Work from OPF metadata and are
  sha256-idempotent, persisting via `blockWriter.ts`. Figure blocks have their transient image src
  resolved against the parser's extracted chapter images and stored content-addressed
  (`figureImageResolver.ts` → `imageResourceStore`), stamping `image_resource_id` + `alt`; an
  unsupported (e.g. SVG) or missing image degrades the block to caption-only, and a figure with neither
  a stored image nor a caption is dropped. Between decompose and block-write, EPUB units pass through a
  composable clean-plugin pipeline (`contentFilters.ts`, #275): ordered, individually-toggleable
  `ContentFilter` plugins (`units -> units`) registered in one place (`defaultContentFilters`); no
  filter is the identity. The first plugin (`dropPublisherBoilerplateFilter`) drops high-confidence
  publisher front/back matter units (公版书/关于我们/制作说明/联系/7sbook markers in a unit's title or
  text) so real chapters stay intact; the Markdown path can reuse the same pipeline later.
  `htmlToDocument.ts` is the server-side fidelity ingestion seam (#311, jsdom + prosemirror-model):
  one chapter's XHTML → a `@whetstone/document` PM/Tiptap doc via a `DOMParser` built from an explicit
  rules array bound to `documentSchema` (the pure package carries no `parseDOM` specs), decomposed into
  block rows; fail-loud — any unrecognized block-level element becomes an `unknown` node (raw HTML kept
  verbatim) and emits a structured evidence record, so nothing is silently dropped. `ingestEpub` wires
  this into the real flow: `resolveChapters` runs `htmlToDocument` per chapter, resolves each PM
  `image` node's `src` against that chapter's stored content-addressed images (the same resolution used
  for mdast figures, via `figureImageResolver.ts`) and stamps the resolved store id onto the node's
  `imageResourceId` attr (#310/#312), then the document's top-level PM nodes are dual-written at the
  block-row boundary to the `doc_blocks` table (one row per node, keyed by the node's stable id from
  `assignNodeIds`, with `node_json` carrying the PM node) alongside the existing mdast `blocks` rows
  (the reader renders these PM block rows for EPUB content (#312); mdast block storage stays as the
  Markdown fallback until Markdown ingestion also writes `doc_blocks`); the
  surviving units' fail-loud evidence is logged through the injected
  `ContentDependencies.ingestionLogger`. Both writers
  bulk-insert through `insertBatching.ts` (`insertInBatches` chunks every multi-row INSERT under PostgreSQL's 32767
  bind-parameter limit so large works persist; `assertContentPersisted` turns a silent zero-row
  rollback into a 5xx instead of a false 201). Blocks carry `work_entry_id`, so notes on
  soft-deleted (unit-detached) blocks stay addressable; a work's Markdown can be exported
  (`GET /api/works/:id/content/markdown`, which keeps `loadWorkContent` server-side). The reader no
  longer transfers the whole work: `contentQueries.ts` exposes the lazy-reader read endpoints
  (`loadWorkStructure` / `loadReadingUnitContent` / `locateBlockUnit`): `GET …/structure` (units +
  block counts, no content), `GET …/units/:unitId/content` (one unit's ordered blocks — both the mdast
  `blocks` and the PM `docBlocks`: `{ entryId, node, orderIndex, type }`, the reader's render source),
  and `GET …/blocks/:blockId/unit` (block → owning unit for deep-links / jump-to-note), each 404ing an
  unknown/out-of-work target. (The whole-work `GET …/content` route was removed; admin composes
  structure + per-unit client-side.) `notes/` serves note templates and creates, lists, edits,
  and deletes notes (block-anchored, `annotates` link; scoped to a work through `blocks.work_entry_id`),
  and lists every note the current user owns across works for the Notes mode (`GET /api/notes` →
  `listNotesForUser`, joined to work + author, ordered by work title then note id);
  templates are seeded from the domain on boot
  (`seedNoteTemplates`). `readingPosition/` durably stores each reader's position per (user, work) —
  the last open reading unit + an optional block anchor — in `reading_positions` (composite
  `(user_id, work_entry_id)` PK), upserted via `PUT` and read via `GET /api/works/:id/reading-position`;
  the server is the source of truth so resume survives a localStorage clear / new browser / other device.
  `search/` is read-only block-level library search: `GET /api/search?q=` validates the query, then
  `searchQueries.searchBlocks` runs a case-insensitive `ILIKE` substring scan over non-deleted blocks'
  `plaintext` (joined to work + author, capped at `searchResultLimit`, LIKE wildcards escaped); v0 is a
  substring scan, not ranked FTS (PRODUCT.md "v0 search").
- Source files: `src/files/sourceFileStore.ts` — persists uploaded/manual Markdown and uploaded
  `.epub` bytes under a server-generated path with sha256 (path-traversal-guarded) for provenance
  only; blocks remain the source of truth. `src/files/epubSource.ts` — the EPUB parsing boundary
  (`@lingo-reader/epub-parser`): bytes in, normalized metadata and ordered chapter HTML out (injected
  so commands test against a fake parser). It guards the upload with `src/files/zipArchive.ts`
  (`isZipArchive`, a dependency-free ZIP signature/EOCD check) and rejects non-ZIP bytes before the
  library runs — the library otherwise hangs and emits a process-crashing unhandled rejection on
  non-EPUB input. `src/files/imageResourceStore.ts` — content-addressed image
  store (sha256-keyed, so identical bytes dedupe to one resource) under `imageResourcesDir`, with a
  write-time content-type allowlist (PNG/JPEG/GIF/WebP; SVG and others rejected); served read-only by
  `src/features/images/imageRoutes.ts` (`GET /api/images/:id`, id is the content hash, allowlist
  re-checked at the boundary, no traversal/remote fetch, unknown id → 404). Used by EPUB ingest to
  store figure images (`content/figureImageResolver.ts`) and read back by the reader's `ReaderFigure`.
- Outbound lookup foundation: `src/lookup/` — reusable boundaries for calling external services and
  caching results. `httpClient.ts` (typed GET text/JSON with timeout + custom headers; normalizes
  failures to typed `HttpError`; injected `fetch`), `lookupCache.ts` (keyed TTL cache, injected clock;
  in-memory impl), `jsonValue.ts` (dependency-free narrowing of untrusted JSON). Vocabulary lookup is
  monolingual and key-free, built on free sources and composed by role into the shared
  `DictionaryEntry` (`@whetstone/contracts`): `wordnetProvider.ts` is the offline backbone — the
  bundled, MIT-licensed `wordpos`/`wordnet-db` database (the real instance is built only in the
  composition root and injected behind a `WordPosLike` seam so the provider tests with fakes); it
  groups synsets by part of speech and supplies the synonym sets. `freeDictionaryProvider.ts` is the
  Wiktionary provider over the no-key community Free Dictionary API (pronunciation/IPA, examples,
  etymology, senses). `englishLookup.ts` composes the two by role: pronunciation + etymology from
  Wiktionary; senses Wiktionary-primary with WordNet fallback; synonyms from WordNet (∪ Wiktionary)
  merged in by part of speech — never aligning senses across sources. For Chinese, `cedict.ts` is a
  pure, bundled CC-CEDICT provider: it parses the dataset text into an in-memory `Map` keyed by both
  Simplified and Traditional headwords and maps matches into a `DictionaryEntry` (pinyin as
  pronunciation, glosses as part-of-speech-less senses). The 8MB CC-CEDICT dataset lives in
  `src/lookup/data/` (`cedict.u8.gz` + a `README.md` recording CC BY-SA 4.0 attribution); the
  composition root (`src/index.ts`) reads + gunzips it via `node:zlib` (resolved from
  `import.meta.url`) and `pnpm build` copies `src/lookup/data` into `dist/lookup/data`. For Chinese
  the lookup is **Chinese-first** (#272): `moedictProvider.ts` is the networked 萌典 (moedict) provider
  over the open `https://www.moedict.tw/{word}.json` API — it strips the HTML markup, groups 釋義 by
  詞性 with 例句/書證 as examples, and time-boxes the request — surfaced as the primary tab, with
  CC-CEDICT's English glosses demoted to a secondary fallback tab (`zh-CN`/`zh-TW` →
  `["moedict", "cedict"]`). Each
  `LookupSource` declares the `languages` it serves; `lookupService.ts` resolves the one requested
  source+language tab (English → WordNet/Wiktionary; Chinese → 萌典/CC-CEDICT), returns its composed
  `DictionaryEntry`, and caches by `language:source:term`. Every contributing source's attribution
  rides in
  the entry's `sources`. `wordpos` runs its bundled-index build step via pnpm's `allowBuilds` in
  `pnpm-workspace.yaml`. The adapters are pure (tested against canned data via the fake transport /
  sample text, plus one offline integration test against the real WordNet database).
  The route lives in `src/features/lookup/lookupRoutes.ts` (`GET /api/lookup?term=&language=`,
  language is `en`/`zh-CN`/`zh-TW`, thin: validates the query contract, delegates to the service).
- Tests colocated `*.test.ts`. Invariant: PostgreSQL is the content source of truth; blocks are rows.

### `src/apps/web/` — React + Vite PWA

- Entry: `src/main.tsx` (imports the self-hosted fonts + `styles/theme.css`, mounts `<MotionConfig
reducedMotion="user">` + `<HashRouter>`); root `src/App.tsx` renders the routed shell.
- App shell + routing: `src/app/` — `AppRoutes.tsx` nests the modes under the `AppShell` layout
  route (Library = `AdminLibraryPage` + `WorkContentPanel`, Reader = `ReaderPage`, Practice =
  `SessionPage`, Progress = `ProgressMapPage`, Search = `SearchPage`, Notes = `NotesPage`); `AppShell.tsx` is the responsive frame (one `Primary`
  `<nav>` styled as a desktop sidebar / mobile bottom-bar, wrapped in `SafeArea`, hosting the
  `ThemeToggle` in its footer and the single `ToastViewport` live region) with `navigation.ts`
  destinations. On the `/reader` route the nav (and its `ThemeToggle`) recedes so the reading column
  owns the viewport (immersive reading room); the reader provides its own back-to-Library control.
  Routing is hash-based (origin-independent for file/Capacitor/Tauri); tests use
  `MemoryRouter`.
- Base UI primitives: `src/shared/ui/` — `SafeArea` (`100dvh`/`svh` + safe-area insets, never
  `100vh`), `Button` (token variants via `cva`; a `pending` prop shows a `Spinner`, sets `aria-busy`,
  and disables so an in-flight action cannot double-submit), `Sheet` (Radix Dialog: focus trap +
  dismissal; right side panel on desktop / bottom sheet on mobile via `useMediaQuery`; tokenized Framer
  spring honoring reduced motion). Loading/pending state has two shared pieces: `Spinner.tsx` (CSS
  spin under normal motion; under reduced motion the global animation freeze stops the rotation and
  the `loadingSpinner` class keeps it active with a reduced-motion-safe opacity pulse so it never
  freezes into a static icon) and `LoadingIndicator.tsx` (spinner + label as a polite
  `aria-busy` `status`) — used for every page/section loader. App-wide result notifications live in
  `src/shared/ui/toast/`: `ToastProvider.tsx` owns the auto-dismissing queue and exposes `useToast()`
  (`success`/`error`); `App.tsx` wraps the app in it and `AppShell` mounts the one `ToastViewport.tsx`
  live region that renders the presentational `Toast.tsx` (success = polite `status`, error = assertive
  `alert`). Components use semantic token utilities only.
- Design system (PRODUCT.md "v0 design language"): `src/styles/theme.css` defines the Tailwind v4
  `@theme` semantic tokens (OKLCH + hex fallback) with Day defaults and `.dark` Night overrides
  (class strategy), self-hosted Inter/Source Serif 4, the language-aware reading stack, and motion
  vars. `src/shared/theme/` is the theme controller (`theme.ts` pure rules, `useTheme.ts` applies the
  `.dark` class + persists, `ThemeToggle.tsx` the sun/moon icon button mounted in the shell footer); `src/shared/motion/motion.tokens.ts` holds the motion tokens and `motion.ts`
  the `withReducedMotion` guard (behavior). The legacy `styles.css` is kept until screens migrate to tokens.
- Features: `src/features/<feature>/` with page + `*Api.ts` (current: `library/`, `content/`,
  `reader/`, `notes/`, `lookup/`, `search/`). `search/` is the Search mode: `SearchPage.tsx` is a query
  field whose `searchApi.searchLibrary` hits `GET /api/search`, rendering block-level hits that each
  deep-link the reader to the work/block (`#/reader?work=&block=`), with explicit empty/error states.
  `library/` is the admin home: `AdminLibraryPage.tsx` shows works as cards
  grouped by author (`groupWorksByAuthor.ts`) with an "Add work" `Sheet` dialog, and uploads
  an `.epub` to create a Work (`libraryApi.ingestEpub` posts the raw bytes); each card's "Continue
  reading" deep-links to `#/reader?work=<entryId>` (with an optional `&block=<entryId>` to open a
  specific block). `reader/` is **目录-driven and lazy-loads one reading unit at a time** (no whole-book
  transfer or freeze): it fetches the lightweight `…/structure` first (`buildReaderStructure`) and pulls
  each unit's blocks on demand via `…/units/:id/content` (`readerApi.ts`: `fetchWorkStructure` /
  `fetchUnitContent` / `locateBlockUnit`), with an explicit per-unit loading state and an error+Retry;
  `readerModel.ts` carries each block's stored mdast for direct, re-parse-free rendering (no Markdown
  round-trip; `blockToMarkdown` stays for the export path only);
  `readerNavigation.ts` holds the pure unit helpers (TOC labels, clamp, unit-by-entry-id, work-level
  progress) and `readingPosition.ts` resolves the opening unit (deep-link `?block=` via the locator,
  else saved position, else first); `ReaderToc.tsx` is the 目录 — a controlled,
  dismissable drawer (opened from the ReadingHeader 目录 tool over a backdrop, never a persistent
  sidebar) listing units with the current one marked. `ReaderPage.tsx` is the immersive single-column reading room: a work is opened from the
  Library via `?work=` (no in-reader work-picker or page heading; with no work open it shows an explicit
  "Open a work from your Library" empty state), with a back-to-Library hash anchor always reachable. It
  keeps an `activeUnitIndex` and the active unit's load state, fetches that unit's blocks when it opens
  (TOC select / jump / deep-link / position restore all switch the unit then scroll once its blocks land),
  renders only that unit. The reader's render path is now the **PM document model** (#312 live swap):
  each block's persisted ProseMirror node (the unit's `doc_blocks`, #311, served as the content DTO's
  `docBlocks`) is rendered to React through `@tiptap/static-renderer` via `PmDocument.tsx` — the
  per-block `PmBlock` export (so `ReaderBlockView` stays memoized per block, perf #72, rather than
  re-rendering the whole unit). `PmDocument` supplies an explicit per-node React mapping covering every
  #310 node type (the specs carry no `renderHTML`), stamps `data-block-id` = the PM node's stable
  UniqueID on each top-level block (so notes/position/search/selection anchor by block + offset), keeps
  links inert (no in-content navigation; v0 has no cross-document in-book link resolution), and prints
  the `unknown` fallback as inert escaped text (never `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, no fetch). It reuses the
  `.reader` typography/theme classes; `PmDocument.tokens.ts` holds its presentational
  heading-tag/callout-kind class maps. A Markdown work with no PM blocks falls back to the legacy mdast
  path (`mdastBlock.tsx`: `mdast-util-to-hast` → `hast-util-sanitize` → `hast-util-to-jsx-runtime`, no
  Markdown re-parse, sanitize schema disallows `img`) until Markdown ingestion also writes `doc_blocks`.
  A `figure` block renders a real `<figure>` (`ReaderFigure` in `ReaderPage.tsx`): for a PM figure the
  stored image is read from the PM `image` node's `imageResourceId` (+ `alt`) and the caption from its
  `figureCaption` child; for an mdast figure from the block's image fields. Either way the image is
  served from `GET /api/images/:id` (lazy, display-only, not selectable) above its
  still-selectable/annotatable caption, degrading to caption-only when the image is absent
  (unsupported/missing at ingest) or fails to load at runtime. **Note-highlight underlines are deferred
  to #313:** this slice renders PM content and keeps selection + note CAPTURE working, but no longer
  draws existing notes' underline marks (`noteMarks.ts` is unused by the reader now); they return as
  ProseMirror Decorations anchored by block-id + offset in the annotation slice. A whole-block note
  still shows a restrained hue gutter bar with a "View note" affordance. The reader opens the
  `?work=`/`?block=` target on arrival via `AppRoutes`' `ReaderRoute`. The reading `article` is whetstone's own
  selection surface: it prevents the right-click `contextmenu` and uses `-webkit-touch-callout: none`
  with `user-select: text` so the mobile/Capacitor long-press callout doesn't collide with the
  toolbar while text stays selectable (the desktop browser selection mini-menu is a user setting,
  out of scope). Selecting text (`blockSelection.ts`
  reads the selected text and its offset from the live Range; `selectionRect.ts` reads the
  Range rect for anchoring) opens a floating `SelectionToolbar` (two primary actions — Add note
  and Look up) on mouse-up, key-up, or touch-end; annotations are disjoint, so a selection
  overlapping an existing note disables Add note with a hint while Look up stays (`noteOverlap.ts`).
  Confirming opens the `notes/` editor (where the
  size-preselected template is chosen), and a saved
  block's highlight is "born" via `highlightBirth.ts`. The per-work note list ("Your notes") opens
  in a toggled `Sheet` panel from the ReadingHeader notes tool (no longer pinned to the reading
  column); jumping back from a note card loads the unit holding the block (when it differs
  from the open one) then scrolls/focuses it via `scrollToBlock.ts`. The reader is the calm `paper` reading surface (`.reading-surface` +
  `readerPaper`, `lang` from the work for CJK measure): `ReadingHeader.tsx` is the receding reading
  chrome — a minimal title + a thin top progress line plus the one home for every reading tool
  (text-size, Day/Night `ThemeToggle`, the 目录 toggle as a contents icon, and the notes toggle),
  laid out as a **right-edge vertical icon rail on desktop** (framing the reading column; returns on
  hover / scroll-up via `useReaderScroll.ts`) and a **top bar hidden by default on mobile** (a center
  tap on the reading area toggles it; `ReaderPage.tsx` owns the narrow-screen tap state). The whole
  chrome recedes as one through the `data-hidden` flag. `readingSize.ts` holds the
  text-size steps (`--reading-size`); `annotationHue.tokens.ts` maps a note template to its hue key
  for the underline (`noteMark--<hue>`) and whole-block gutter (`readerBlock--<hue>`) classes.
  Block content (lists, code, blockquotes, tables, footnotes) renders to the PRODUCT.md readability
  targets via the `.reader` rules in `styles/theme.css` (even rhythm owned by `.readerBlock`, restored
  list markers, monospace code surface, ~66ch measure); `readerHeadings.ts` decides when a unit's
  eyebrow title duplicates its first heading (`isUnitTitleRedundant`) so the title is not shown twice,
  and `readerModel` flags heading blocks via `ReaderBlock.isHeading`.
  Reading position is durable **server** state, remembered per (user, work) — never localStorage:
  `readingPosition.ts` is the pure compute layer (`resolveOpening` picks the opening unit/block-scroll
  target from a deep link or the saved position), `readingAnchor.ts` finds the topmost visible block,
  `readingPositionApi.ts` reads/writes `GET`/`PUT /api/works/:id/reading-position` (server is the
  source of truth, so resume survives a localStorage clear / new browser / other device), and
  `useReadingPositionWriter.ts` saves the current unit + best-effort block anchor (immediately on
  unit change, debounced on scroll) so reopening a work resumes where it left off.
  `notes/` is the note feature: `noteCapture.ts` turns a block selection into a
  draft, `SelectionToolbar.tsx` is the anchored capture toolbar, `templateHue.tokens.ts` maps a template to
  its control swatch, `NoteEditor.tsx` is the template-based create/edit editor hosted in the shared
  `Sheet` with a hued segmented template control, `NoteList.tsx` renders notes as hued cards
  (template chip + snippet + answers) with jump-back/edit/delete,
  `notesApi.ts` calls the templates/notes endpoints. The Notes mode page is `NotesPage.tsx`: it
  fetches the cross-work overview (`notesApi.fetchAllNotes`), groups it by work (`groupNotesByWork.ts`),
  and links each note back to its anchored block in the Reader (`#/reader?work=&block=`). Shared
  `ui/Toast.tsx` shows transient,
  reduced-motion-aware status confirmations. `lookup/` is the view-only vocabulary lookup: selecting
  text exposes a "Look up" action on the `SelectionToolbar`; `LookupPanel.tsx` renders the enriched
  `DictionaryEntry` as a mature online-dictionary card — headword with pronunciations (and an audio
  control when available), color-coded part-of-speech sections (`partOfSpeechHue.tokens.ts` maps each part of
  speech to a tokenized, Day/Night hue class), numbered senses with italic examples and synonym chips,
  a quiet etymology line, and a sources footer — in a compact Radix popover anchored near the selection
  on desktop/tablet, and a content-height bottom `Sheet` on narrow screens (it scrolls for long
  entries), with explicit loading/empty/error states. Each work language fetches an ordered set of
  source tabs (`lookupSourcesForLanguage`), and `preferredTab` defaults to the first loaded-or-loading
  source in that order so the language's lead source stays the default — 萌典's Chinese definitions for
  Chinese (#272), offline WordNet for English — without trapping on a dead/empty source. `lookupApi.ts`
  calls `GET /api/lookup`. The reader passes the open work's language so Chinese selections lead with
  萌典 and fall back to CC-CEDICT automatically. Lookup never creates, pre-fills, or edits a note.
  `content/` is the Work detail surface (`WorkContentPanel.tsx`): a work switcher, a header
  (title/author/type/language + unit/block counts via `workContentSummary.ts`), an "Open in Reader"
  deep-link, a calm add-content area (manual Markdown + `.md` upload) reporting the ingestion result,
  and a units/blocks overview; `contentApi.ts` calls the content/ingest endpoints.
- Cross-feature UI lands in `src/shared/ui/`, client API helpers in `src/shared/api/` (created when
  first needed). Tests colocated `*.test.ts(x)`.

## Build, validate, run

- Workspace: pnpm + TypeScript project references. `pnpm install` then `pnpm build` before first use.
- Run/use walkthrough: `docs/QUICK_START.md` (install, env/data config, run server + web, first note flow).
- Dev (one command): `pnpm dev` (`scripts/dev.mjs`) builds the shared packages once, then runs the API server from source with reload (`tsx watch`) and the Vite web dev server together — route changes go live with no manual `build`. Production still runs the built `dist` via `pnpm --filter @whetstone/server start`.
- Gate: `pnpm validate` (= `typecheck && lint && test && build && smoke && e2e`); mirrors `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. `smoke` (`src/apps/web/dev-smoke.mjs`) boots the Vite dev server and checks every dependency resolves at serve time — catching dev-only breakage that `build` (rolldown) does not.
- Deploy (continuous, to a personal MacBook): `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` runs **only on push to `main`**, `runs-on: self-hosted`, gated on the `DEPLOY_ENABLED` repo variable (skips until set). It builds, then restarts a `launchd` app service that serves the single origin (web `dist` + `/api`) and migrates on boot; `DATABASE_DIR` persists across deploys; HTTPS via a Cloudflare Tunnel. Setup runbook: `docs/DEPLOY.md`.
- E2E smoke (merge gate): `pnpm e2e` (`e2e/`, `@playwright/test`) boots the real stack — Fastify + in-memory PGlite + the Vite **dev** server (React dev mode) — seeded with a fixture EPUB and a small Markdown work, then drives the core reader loop in Chromium (open work → chapter; select in paragraph/blockquote/list → toolbar; add note → reload-persists; look up a word → definition). Every test fails on any console error, app-origin HTTP 4xx/5xx, or React hydration/DOM-nesting warning (`e2e/fixtures.ts`). Boot/seed harness: `e2e/stack.ts` + `e2e/globalSetup.ts`. CI installs Chromium (`playwright install --with-deps chromium`).
- Screenshots (manual, outside the gate): `pnpm screenshots` (`scripts/screenshots.mjs`) boots the real stack on an ephemeral in-memory DB, ingests the public-domain `fixtures/epub/` files through the live pipeline, serves the production build via `vite preview`, and drives Playwright Chromium to write per-stage PNGs to `artifacts/screenshots/` (git-ignored). `scripts/make-fixture-epub.mjs` regenerates the English fixture. Needs `pnpm exec playwright install chromium` once.
- Workflow roles: `.github/agents/*.agent.md` (design, developer, reviewer, tester). The **tester** (QA) is the exploratory bug-discovery layer above the E2E gate — `scripts/run-tester.cmd` / `run-tester-auto.cmd` + `scripts/tester-next-action.mjs` (queue-driven per-run filing budget); it boots the real stack on `main`, drives the app beyond the smoke, and files de-duplicated `[Bug]`s (read-only on code). Operational quick-reference: the
  `whetstone-engineering` skill in `.github/skills/`.
