# Repository map

Navigational index: subsystems to their locations. **Pointers and invariants only — never
restated code behavior.** Read `PRODUCT.md` and `GUIDELINES.md`, then this map, then only the one
feature slice you need. Maintained per `GUIDELINES.md` -> "Knowledge surfaces and onboarding cost":
updated by the same PR that changes an area's shape, not on every change.

When a folder below outgrows its single entry here, give it a colocated `AGENTS.md` and shrink its
entry to a pointer.

## Packages

### `src/packages/domain/` — pure logic

Entry/link/block/template/note-anchor rules with no React, Fastify, DB, fs, or env. Public surface is
`src/index.ts`. Current units: `entry.ts`, `links.ts`, `block.ts`, `markdownBlocks.ts` (decompose
Markdown into ordered, stable-id blocks), `author.ts`, `work.ts`, `noteAnchor.ts`,
`productIdentity.ts`. Tests are colocated `*.test.ts`. Invariant: depends on nothing outward.

### `src/packages/contracts/` — shared API schemas/DTOs

Zod request/response contracts shared by client and server. Public surface is `src/index.ts`.
Current contracts: `entryContracts.ts`, `libraryContracts.ts`, `contentContracts.ts`, `health.ts`. Tests colocated.
Invariant: types resolve through built `dist` — run `pnpm build` (or `tsc -b`) before VS Code/tsc
can navigate them from another package.

## Apps

### `src/apps/server/` — Fastify API

- Composition/entry: `src/index.ts`; server assembly in `src/http/createServer.ts`.
- Config: `src/config/serverConfig.ts`.
- Data: `src/db/` — `schema.ts` (Drizzle), `dbClient.ts`, `migrate.ts`, `migrations/`.
- Features (feature-first): `src/features/<feature>/` with `*Routes.ts`, `*Commands.ts`,
  `*Queries.ts` (current: `library/`, `content/`). Routes stay thin; logic lives in commands/queries.
- Source files: `src/files/sourceFileStore.ts` — persists uploaded/manual Markdown under a
  server-generated path with sha256 (path-traversal-guarded) for provenance only; blocks remain the
  source of truth.
- Tests colocated `*.test.ts`. Invariant: PostgreSQL is the content source of truth; blocks are rows.

### `src/apps/web/` — React + Vite PWA

- Entry: `src/main.tsx`; root `src/App.tsx`; styles `src/styles.css`.
- Features: `src/features/<feature>/` with page + `*Api.ts` (current: `library/`, `content/`).
- Cross-feature UI lands in `src/shared/ui/`, client API helpers in `src/shared/api/` (created when
  first needed). Tests colocated `*.test.ts(x)`.

## Build, validate, run

- Workspace: pnpm + TypeScript project references. `pnpm install` then `pnpm build` before first use.
- Gate: `pnpm validate` (= `typecheck && lint && test && build`); mirrors `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
- Workflow roles: `.github/agents/*.agent.md` (design, developer, reviewer). Operational quick-reference: the
  `whetstone-engineering` skill in `.github/skills/`.
